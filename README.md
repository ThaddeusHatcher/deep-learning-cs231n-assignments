# deep-learning-cs231n-assignments

This repository contains my implementations for the Stanford course cs231n assignments. 

This course and its content available [here](http://cs231n.github.io/) served as the basis for my Deep Learning course at Auburn University taken Spring 2019. 

Portions of assignments 1 and 2 were assigned as homework for us. I intend to complete the remaining portions of these assignments and the other assignments available at the link above in my spare time to further my knowledge of deep learning and neural networks, which are things I have become increasingly fascinated by the more I have learned about them.
